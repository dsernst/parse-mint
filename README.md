## How it works

0. Sign up for Mint and link the financial accounts you want to track.
1. Enable the weekly email reports.
2. Set up a Gmail filter to auto-forward these reports to [auto@stache.dsernst.com](mailto:auto@stache.dsernst.com)
  - The first time, you'll need to add your phone number.

Now you'll automatically receive notifications by text message.
